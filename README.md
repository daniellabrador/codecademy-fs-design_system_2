# **Azure Style Guide**

This style guide is my second iteration to the [Codecademy project prompt](#codecademy-project-prompt) below with the time limit of two hours, including the conceptualization and the writing of contents. My first iteration was called "[Fire and Ice](https://github.com/daniellabrador/codecademy-fs-design_system)" which was done with more time in my hands but with less experience.

## Codecademy Project Prompt

In this project, you’ll build a style guide/design system for your website. Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

To complete this project, you should have completed the Codecademy lessons covering the CSS box model, display and positioning, colors, and typography. You can use more advanced CSS layout concepts like flexbox, CSS grid, or responsive design, but they won’t be required. You can take a look at our [basic example site](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/website-design-system/example/index.html) for a taste of what you’ll be building (yours will be customized)."
